OXYGEN EXTRACTION ANALYSIS

Oxygen extraction = SO₂ at vessel entrance minus SO₂ at exit.

Positive value → tissue consumed oxygen (expected).

Negative value → possible sensor error or reversal.


1,576 vessels (12.84%) have both entrance and exit SO₂.

Average oxygen extraction: +0.0041 (median +0.0000, std 0.3294)

278 vessels (17.64%) show oxygen increase (violations).


Example violations (first 3):

  Animal 1, oxycam1_BL40-00, vessel 81: start 0.000 → end 0.144

  Animal 1, oxycam1_BL40-00, vessel 4: start 0.986 → end 1.000

  Animal 1, oxycam1_BL40-00, vessel 17: start 0.000 → end 0.402
