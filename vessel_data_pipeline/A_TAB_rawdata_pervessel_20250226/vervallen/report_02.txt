VESSEL POPULATION AND CLASSIFICATION (ALL ANIMALS)

The vessel population was dominated by capillaries. Out of 12,271 vessels, 11,688 were classified as capillaries (Type 0, 95.2%), while 583 were venules or larger vessels (Type 1, 4.8%). This distribution is consistent with dense capillary networks in tissue beds.


EXPERIMENTAL SESSIONS AND CONDITIONS

Data was acquired in 39 distinct imaging sessions. The three most sampled sessions were:

  • 'oxycam5T260-00' with 420 vessels

  • 'oxycam1_T421-00' with 392 vessels

  • 'oxycam2_T5_fio2-21-00' with 389 vessels

Each session corresponds to a unique combination of camera, time point, and FiO₂ level (e.g., baseline, hypoxia, hyperoxia).


OXYGEN EXTRACTION AND TISSUE METABOLISM

Oxygen extraction was successfully measured in 1,576 vessels (12.8% of total). On average, tissue extracted +0.0041 units of SO₂ per vessel (median +0.0000, standard deviation 0.3294). This small positive drop indicates normal oxygen consumption by surrounding tissue.


However, 278 vessels (17.6%) showed an increase in SO₂ from entrance to exit — a physiological impossibility under steady state. These violations are likely due to sensor noise, motion artifacts, or misaligned vessel tracking. The first three examples are:

  • Animal 1, session 'oxycam1_BL40-00', vessel 81: SO₂ 0.000 → 0.144

  • Animal 1, session 'oxycam1_BL40-00', vessel 4: SO₂ 0.986 → 1.000

  • Animal 1, session 'oxycam1_BL40-00', vessel 17: SO₂ 0.000 → 0.402

VESSEL DIMENSIONS AND CAPILLARY CONFIRMATION

Physical vessel diameter was estimated from volume and length assuming cylindrical geometry. Across 12,271 valid vessels, the average diameter was 9.73 µm (median 8.87 µm).

Using the standard physiological threshold, 8,642 vessels (70.4%) had diameters ≤ 10 µm and are confirmed as true capillaries.



OXYGEN SATURATION IN RELATION TO VESSEL DIAMETER

In true capillaries (≤ 10 µm, n=1,307), average SO₂ was 0.8% at entrance and 0.8% at exit, resulting in an oxygen extraction of +0.006 units. This confirms efficient gas exchange in the smallest vessels.

In larger vessels (> 10 µm, n=269), SO₂ was 0.7% at entrance and 0.7% at exit, with extraction of -0.005 units — typically lower due to less surface-area-to-volume ratio.

Capillaries extracted +0.011 more SO₂ per vessel than larger vessels, highlighting their dominant role in tissue oxygenation.
